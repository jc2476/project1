            <h3>Terms</h3>
            <b>Instantiation</b> - The creation of a real instance or particular realization of an abstraction or
            template such as a class of objects or a computer process.
            <br>
            <b>Object</b> - Things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that
            are eventually derived from the process. <br>
            <b>Class</b> - A template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. <br>
            <b>Namespace</b> - A declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types,
            functions, variables, etc) inside it. <br>
            <b>Constructor</b> - A special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that
            initializes a newly created object of that type. <br>
            <b>Fixture</b> - Functions which will run before each test function to which it is applied. <br>
            <b>Type Hint</b> - A formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.
            <br>
            <b>Type Cast</b> - Changing an variable of one data type into another. <br>
            <b>Unit Test</b> - A software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more
            computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating
            procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. <br>
            <b>Static</b> - A keyword that can be used to declare a member of a type so that it is specific to that
            type. <br>
            <b>Instance Method</b> - Methods which require an object of its class to be created before it can be called.
            <br>
            <b>Instance Property</b> - A typical property declared in a class. <br>
            <b>Static Method</b> - A method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API
            object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor. <br>
            <b>Static Property</b> - The properties inside a static method shared by all instances of a class. <br>

            <p>Object oriented programming (OOP) is based on the concept of objects. Prior to OOP, you had
                procedural programming where data was stored in a set of variables. This is a simple and
                straightforward way of programming and today, it is typically used as a starting point for new
                programmers. As your programs grow, the number of functions increase and multiple functions will
                need to be changed as your program changes. OOP can solve this problem by combining groups of
                related functions and variables in objects. Objects can contain data in the form of properties
                or attributes as well as actions in the form of functions or methods. </p>
            <p>There are four major principles of Object Oriented Programming which are Encapsulation,
                Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. They are defined as follows:</p>

            <b>Abstraction</b>
            <p>Used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the
                data so
                that users only see the required information. Abstraction will only show the necessary
                details
                of
                the
                object to the user. This will make the interface more simple to work and will also
                reduce the
                impact
                of
                change.</p>

        <div class="col-6">
            <b>Inheritance</b>
            <p>The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class,
                retaining
                similar implementation. Inheritance allows code to be reused. It is useful when you have an
                existing
                class but want to create a new class and reuse code but with additional features. Classes that
                are
                derived from an existing class can be called a sublcass, extended class, or child class. The
                class
                from
                which the subclass is derived from is called either a super class, parent class, or base class.
                Inheritance basically reduces the amount of code you need to write.</p><br><br><br>

            <b>Encapsulation</b>
            <p>The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the
                restricting
                of direct access to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is built on the idea of
                data
                hiding. This is accomplished when each object maintains a private state inside a class. This
                is
                an
                important concept when the user should not have access to change certain data. The
                properties
                and
                data are "encapsulated" within the object.</p>

            <b>Polymorphism</b>
            <p>The provision of a single interface to entities of different types, or the use
                of a
                single symbol to represent multiple different types. Polymorphism allows you to determine
                what
                type
                of
                functions to run while the program is running. This will allow the user to use less code by
                using
                common
                properties and the program will behave differently.</p><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>Types of Design Patterns</h3>
        <img class="w-50 center" src="/static/images/dpatterns.jpg" alt="Design Patterns">
        <p>
            Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They can be thought of as
            pre-made blueprints that can be customized to fit a users code. The pattern is a general concept for
            solving a particular problem and can't just be copied into your program. Design patterns can be thought
            of as a toolkit with tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Patterns are
            classified into three main groups:</p><br><br>
