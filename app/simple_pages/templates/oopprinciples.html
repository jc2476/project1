<h3>Terms</h3>
<b>Instantiation</b> - The creation of a real instance or particular realization of an abstraction or template such as a class of objects or a computer process.
    <br>
<b>Object</b> - Things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. <br>
<b>Class</b> - A template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. <br>
<b>Namespace</b> - A declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. <br>
<b>Constructor</b> - A special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. <br>
<b>Fixture</b> - Functions which will run before each test function to which it is applied. <br>
<b>Type Hint</b> - A formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code. <br>
<b>Type Cast</b> - Changing an variable of one data type into another. <br>
<b>Unit Test</b> - A software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. <br>
<b>Static</b> - A keyword that can be used to declare a member of a type so that it is specific to that type. <br>
<b>Instance Method</b> -  Methods which require an object of its class to be created before it can be called. <br>
<b>Instance Property</b> - A typical property declared in a class. <br>
<b>Static Method</b> - A method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor. <br>
<b>Static Property</b> - The properties inside a static method shared by all instances of a class. <br>
<b>Encapsulation</b> - The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components. <br>
<b>Inheritance</b> - The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. <br>
<b>Polymorphism</b> - The provision of a single interface to entities of different types, or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types. <br>
<b>Abstraction</b> - Used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. <br>
<br>

            <h3>Overview of Design Patterns</h3>
Design matterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. The can be thought of as pre-made blueprints that can be customized to fit a users code. The pattern is a general concept for solving a particular problem and can't just be copied into your program. Design patterns can be thought of as a toolkit with tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Patterns are classified into three main groups:<br><br>
<b>Creational patterns</b> - Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibiliyt and reuse of existing code.<br>
<b>Structural patters</b> - These explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.<br>
<b>Behavioral patterns</b> - Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.<br>
