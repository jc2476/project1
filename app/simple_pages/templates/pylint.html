            <p><b>Testing applications has become an imperative part of developing software and a skill every developer
                should have. Releasing any untested software or applications could lead to major issues with bugs and
                unusable programs. Python has an extensive library of tools to support testing, particularly, Pytest.
                Pytest is a frontrunner for testing due to its ease of use and ability to handle complex testing

            <p>Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code. It attempts to enforce a coding standard and
                looks for code "smells". Pytest can also look for certain types of errors, make recommendations about
                how certain code block and be refactored and offer you details about the complexity of the code. </p>

            <h1>Pytest Code Coverage</h1>
            <p>Code coverage is a measure of exhaustiveness of a test suite. 100% code coverage means that a systems is
                fully tested. The higher the code coverage, the fewer defects a system has. Code coverage canbe broken
                down into three main types:<br><br>
                <b>Statement Coverage</b> - This is used by default in the python code coverage library. <br>
                <b>Branch Coverage</b> - Tests for un-sequential code such as "if" statements. <br>
                <b>Condition Coverage</b> - This tests for True/False statements </p>
