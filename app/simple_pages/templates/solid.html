            <h3>Overview of SOLID</h3>
            SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles by Robert C. Martin. These
            principles are guidelines used to establish uniformity among programmers. These principles can apply to
            various programming languages and can be shared with collaborators to be with fewer complications.<br><br>

            <p><i>"A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one
                job"</i></p>
            <br>
            <p>This example clearly shows the Single-Responsibility since each mathematical operation has its own class
                to perform the correct computation. </p>

            <p>This Addition Calculation class is an example of the Open-Closed Principle. This objected is closed for
                modification since the sum of values need to be calculated in an exact way. If this class is modified,
                it will cause the calculations to be incorrect. </p>

            <img class="w-50 center" src="/static/images/dpatterns.jpg" alt="Design Patterns"><br><br>
            <p><br>
                Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They can be thought
                of
                as
                pre-made blueprints that can be customized to fit a users code. The pattern is a general concept
                for
                solving a particular problem and can't just be copied into your program. Design patterns can be
                thought
                of as a toolkit with tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Patterns
                are
                classified into three main groups:<br><br></p><br><br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-4">
            <img class="center" src="/static/images/Creational.jpeg" alt="Creational">
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">

            <p> These patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of
                existing code. They emphasize the automatic creation of objects within code, rather than
                requiring
                you to
                instantiate objects manually. Many times, a function or method can call the code necessary to
                instantiate
                new objects for you so you only need to make modifications to the object creation when necessary
                and
                allow
                the default behaviors to run. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p>Creational design patterns are the Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool,
                and
                Prototype. </p> The <b>Factory Method</b> is one of the core design principles to create an object,
            allowing clients to create objects of a library in such a way that it doesn't have tight coupling with the
            class hierachy of the library.<br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="row justify-content-center">

        <div class="col-4">
            <img class="center" src="/static/images/structural.jpg" alt="Structural">
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">

            <p>Structural patters explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures,
                while keeping the structures flexible and efficient. They focus on the composition of classes
                and by
                using
                inheritance and interfaces, allow objects to be composed in a manner that offers new
                functionality.
                In many
                cases, an interface in object-oriented programming is an abstract type of class without logical
                code
                and is
                used to define method behaviors for other classes that will implement the interface.</p></div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p>Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class
                Data, and Proxy.</p>
            <p>The <b>Adapter Pattern</b> converts the interface of a class into another interface or class that the
                client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatibility.

        <div class="col-4">
            <p>Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment
                of responsibilities between objects. The operations that make up a single algorithm might be
                split
                up
                between different classes which make it difficult to manage. Behavioral patterns optimize how
                communications
                should be handled between various classes. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p>Behavioral patterns are Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null
                Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template method, Visitor </p>
            <p>The <b>Template Method</b> lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
                algorithm structure. You want the behavior of the module to be able to extend, such that we can make the
                module behave in new and different ways.</p>
