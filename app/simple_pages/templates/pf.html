            <h2>Python/Flask</h2>
            <p>Python is a computer programming language that is has become increasingly popular in recent years. It has
                helped to create many of the applications that are used in everyday life from data science, to software
                and web development, and also automation.
                Flask is a web framework within Python. A web framework is a collection of libraries and modules that
                enable developers to write applications without the need to deal with low-level details. These
                applications can range from a simple page to a full commercial website.
                When using Flask, plugins such as utility libraries or template engines are available to assist in
                coding. A template engine allows a developer to set a basic layout for pages and set which element to
                change. This is particularly useful if you want to make a simple change across an entire site such as a
                menu or footer item. The developer will make the change in one place and it will reflect throughout the
                entire site.
                For example:
                Within this website is a base.html file. This file contains code for the heading and footer of the site.
                A simple edit to the menu code will reflect across the entire site.
            </p>
            <p>In the following screenshots of this website, Fig. 1 shows how set variables are passed into the footer
                of the base.html code. The {year} tag is defined in one central location and can be passed anywhere
                within the website.

            </p>
            <p>
                The same goes for actual html pages as shown in Fig. 2. Base.html contains the code for the menu and
                footer
                for this website. When index.html is accessed, it pulls data from base.html first, then continues to
                process
                the code that is contained on the page.

            <p>As shown below in Fig.5, certain tests are put into place to ensure the program works correctly. As
                shown, these tests include the menu links as well as each page. A value is entered into the test file
                and when the test is run, Pytest ensures that the value specified is on the page.
                In this screenshot, each line of code in the first section will check the menu for a link to Home, Git,
                Docker, Python/Flask, and CI/CD. If one of the links are missing or correctly display, the test will
                fail.
